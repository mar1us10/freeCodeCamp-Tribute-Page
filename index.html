        An advanced playmaker who operated in the classic number 10 position,
        Maradona was the first player to set the world record transfer fee
        twice: in 1982 when he transferred to Barcelona for £5 million, and in
        1984 when he moved to Napoli for a fee of £6.9 million.[7] He played for
        Argentinos Juniors, Boca Juniors, Barcelona, Napoli, Sevilla, and
        Newell's Old Boys during his club career, and is most famous for his
        time at Napoli and Barcelona, where he won numerous accolades.
